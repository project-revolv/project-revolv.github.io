# 🧠 Idea 001: Delta Programming Language

---

## 🔍 What is Delta?

**Delta** is a high-performance, compiled, self-hosting programming language designed to strike the perfect balance between low-level control and modern developer ergonomics.

Fast to **run**. Fast to **write**. Fast to **evolve**.

---

## 🔑 Core Features (Planned)

- 🧵 Static typing
- 🔄 Self-hosting compiler
- 🧱 Modular build system
- 📦 Package manager baked-in
- 🔐 Memory safety without garbage collection
- 🧠 Clean syntax inspired by multiple modern languages
- 🛠️ Easily embeddable into other projects

---

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- OS kernel and system-level development
- Building your own compiler and tools in itself
- Writing performance-critical backend services
- Creating modules for game engines and embedded software
