# âœ… TODO: Programming Language

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Must-Have (MVP)
- [x] Design core syntax (functions, variables, types)
- [ ] Define file/module structure
- [ ] Write lexer
- [ ] Write parser
- [ ] Plan AST structure
- [ ] Write code generator (start with C backend or LLVM)
- [ ] Minimal standard library (print, file I/O, memory)

---

## ðŸ§ª Nice to Have (Later)
- [ ] Built-in testing framework
- [ ] Built-in benchmarking
- [ ] Language server support (LSP)
- [ ] Package manager CLI
- [ ] Optional runtime safety checks (debug mode)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas to Explore
- [ ] Tag-based memory model or arena allocation
- [ ] Import system with version pinning
- [ ] Declarative macros
- [ ] Simple concurrency model (coroutines or fibers)
