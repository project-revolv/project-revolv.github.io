# 🗺️ Roadmap: Programming Language

---

## 🥚 Phase 0 – Research & Design
- [x] Define high-level goals and philosophy
- [x] Study modern compiler architecture
- [x] List features from Go, Rust, Zig, etc. for inspiration
- [x] Define syntax rules and core grammar
- [x] Choose or build a backend (LLVM, C, or custom)

---

## 🧪 Phase 1 – Bootstrapping MVP
- [ ] Write lexer
- [ ] Write parser
- [ ] Build basic AST representation
- [ ] Compile to C or LLVM IR
- [ ] Create basic CLI to compile and run

---

## 🔁 Phase 2 – Self-Hosting
- [ ] Begin rewriting compiler in itself
- [ ] Build minimal standard library to support self-hosting
- [ ] Get the compiler to compile itself fully

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3 – Tooling & Ecosystem
- [ ] Write code formatter
- [ ] Linter for syntax and idioms
- [ ] Documentation generator
- [ ] Package manager

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 – Community & Stability
- [ ] Write official documentation
- [ ] Open-source on GitHub
- [ ] Set up issue templates and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Engage early contributors
